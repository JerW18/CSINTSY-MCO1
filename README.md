# CSINTSY-MCO1
**CSINTSY Major Course Output 1: Maze Bot**

The project aims to develop a Python-based program that can solve mazes efficiently using the A* search algorithm. Mazes are intriguing puzzles that require finding the optimal path from a start point to an end point while navigating through obstacles. The A* algorithm combines the advantages of both Dijkstra's algorithm and greedy best-first search, making it an ideal choice for maze-solving tasks.

This project will involve implementing the A* algorithm in Python and utilizing the Pygame library for graphical visualization. The MazeBot program will take a maze as input, represented as a grid of cells, and output the shortest path from the start to the end point. The algorithm will intelligently explore the maze by evaluating the cost of each potential path, using a heuristic function that estimates the remaining distance to the goal.
